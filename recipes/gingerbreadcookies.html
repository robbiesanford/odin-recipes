    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 cups flour</li>

        <li>Mix flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in large bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and brown sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add molasses, egg, and vanilla; mix well. Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Press dough into a thick, flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.</li>
