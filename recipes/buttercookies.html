    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This simple butter cookies recipe can be used in a cookie press, made as a drop cookie, or shaped into a roll and sliced. There is no special cookie recipe for a cookie press — any stiff butter type of cookie can be used! Just be sure to chill it thoroughly so it keeps its shape while baking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2⅔ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, then stir in the vanilla. Combine flour and salt in a separate bowl; add to butter mixture and mix to form a dough. Cover dough with plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Chill two cookie sheets.</li>
      <li>Transfer chilled dough to a cookie press; press out onto chilled cookie sheets.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden at the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.</li>
   </ol>
