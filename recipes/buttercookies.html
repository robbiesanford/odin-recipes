    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This simple butter cookies recipe can be used in a cookie press, made as a drop cookie, or shaped into a roll and sliced. There is no special cookie recipe for a cookie press â€” any stiff butter type of cookie can be used! Just be sure to chill it thoroughly so it keeps its shape while baking.</p>
